# Description
Play pong with a friend over a LAN connection!

One player will create a server by specifying a port (try to use ports above 1024 or else it may conflict with other applications).
Then anyone else on the network can connect to that player by entering that person's IP address and the same port number.
(Note: Just open up the command line and type ipconfig to find your IPv4 address)

There are no score limits enforced, so play for as long as you like!

# Instructions

'''git clone "https://github.com/matthewachan/LANPong'''

Then, navigate to the LANPong folder and execute LANPong.jar which is in the dist folder to start playing!
